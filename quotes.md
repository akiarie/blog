Some short words I wish everyone believed.

### God

> 'In the beginning God created'---It is He, beneficent nature, goodness without measure, a worthy
> object of love for all beings endowed with reason, the beauty the most to be desired, the origin
> of all that exists, the source of life, intellectual light, impenetrable wisdom, it is He who 'in
> the beginning created heaven and earth.'

Basil the Great, _The Hex&#230;meron_

### Testimonium Spiritus Sancti

> Nothing can be more absurd than the fiction that the power of judging Scripture is in the Church,
> and that on her nod its certainty depends. When the Church receives it, and gives it the stamp of
> her authority, she does not make that authentic which was otherwise doubtful or controverted but,
> acknowledging it as the truth of God, she, as in duty bounds shows her reverence by an
> unhesitating assent. As to the question, How shall we be persuaded that it came from God without
> recurring to a decree of the Church? it is just the same as if it were asked, How shall we learn
> to distinguish light from darkness, white from black, sweet from bitter? Scripture bears upon the
> face of it as clear evidence of its truth, as white and black do of their colour, sweet and bitter
> of their taste.

Calvin, _Institutes_, I.7.2

### Opinions
> The modern habit of saying 'This is my opinion, but I may be wrong' is entirely irrational. If I
> say that it may be wrong, I say that is not my opinion. The modern habit of saying 'Every man has
> a different philosophy; this is my philosophy and it suits me'---the habit of saying this is mere
> weak-mindedness. A cosmic philosophy is not constructed to fit a man; a cosmic philosophy is
> constructed to fit a cosmos. A man can no more possess a private religion than he can possess a
> private sun and moon.

G.K. Chesterton, _Introduction to Job_

### Jesus
> Love, when it sees, cannot but cast out its spirit and strength upon amiable objects and things
> loveworthy. And what fairer things than Christ! O fair sun, and fair moon, and fair stars, and
> fair flowers, and fair roses, and fair lilies, and fair creatures! but, O ten thousand, thousand
> times fairer Lord Jesus! Alas, I wronged him in making the comparison this way. O black sun and
> moon; but O fair Lord Jesus! O black flowers, and black lilies and roses; but O fair fair, ever
> fair Lord Jesus! O all fair things, black, deformed, and without beauty, when ye are set beside
> the fairest Lord Jesus! O black heaven, but O fair Christ! O black angels, but O surpassingly fair
> Lord Jesus.

John Flavel, _The Fountain of Life Opened Up_
