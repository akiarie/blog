It is an astounding fact that truth of the Christian religion is subjectively verifiable.
"Oh, taste and see" says David in his holy joy: he does not tell us to "reason and conclude that the
LORD is good." (Psalm 34:8) Assurance is the cornerstone of Christian joy. Without it the Christian
remains a child, tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine, subject to the schemes and wiles of
the Evil One. But assurance is also one of the most misunderstood components of the Christian life.
I fear that false assurance will lead more people to hell than any other doctrinal confusion. My
intention in this article and the few that will follow it is to explain the Biblical doctrine of
assurance. Today I will provide an overview, hopefully motivating the closer study that will ensue.

No one outside heaven is happier than the assured Christian; no one outside hell is more miserable
than the unassured Christian. Hear the testimony of an assured saint: "Behold, God is my helper; the
Lord is the upholder of my life" (Psalm 54:4) "My soul will be satisfied as with fat and rich food,
and my mouth will praise you with joyful lips...My soul clings to you and your right hand upholds
me" (Psalm 63:5-8) "I am like a green olive tree in the house of God. I trust in the steadfast love
of God forever and ever" (Psalm 52:8) "My enemies will turn back in the day when I call. This I
know, that God is for me...in God I trust; I shall not be afraid, what can man do to me?" (Psalm
56:9-11) "The LORD is my light and my salvation...the stronghold of my life; of whom shall I be
afraid?" (Psalm 27:1)

But consider the unassured believer, he says: "I walk slowly all my years because of the bitterness
of my soul. In the middle of my days I must depart; I am consigned to the gates of Sheol for the
rest of my years." (Isaiah 38:10-15) "There is no soundness in my flesh because of your
indignation...My wounds stink and fester, I am utterly bowed down and prostrate; all the day I go
about mourning...My heart throbs; my strength fails me, and the light of my eyes---it also has gone
from me." (Psalm 38:1-14) "My tears have been my food day and night, while they say to me all the
day long, 'Where is your God?'" (Psalm 42:3) "All day long my disgrace is before me, and shame has
covered my face" (Psalm 44:15-16) Indeed, so wretched is the condition of the unassured saint that
he sometimes prays words that come close to blasphemies: "Look away from me, that I may smile again,
before I depart and am no more!" (Psalm 39:13)

Assurance plays so crucial a role in the Christian life that it is scarcely impossible to
overestimate its significance. It is secondary but only to salvation itself. If a man is saved, let
him find his assurance before accepting any responsibility in Christian ministry, no matter how
trivial. An unassured believer is a danger to himself and his listeners. But let a man be assured of
his salvation, he will weather any storm and bear any cross while singing hymns. He will fear no
man---indeed he has no fear of God's judgement because "perfect love casts out fear" (1 John
4:17-18).

I hope then that the urgency and importance of understanding this doctrine is clear. Friend, much of
the Bible was written in order that you might have certainty regarding the things you have been
taught (Luke 1:4). If you consider yourself a believer, there is nothing you need more than a firm
grasp of the nature of true assurance. Understanding assurance will encourage you and bolster your
joy, if your profession is sound. On the other hand, if you are a false professor of Christ,
understanding this doctrine might be your only hope of uncovering this fact before it's too
late---lest you receive a rude awakening on that Day which is so fast approaching. So I implore you
to join me on this brief excursion, and to begin by invoking the aid of him who is our peace (Micah
5:5).

_Lord Jesus, you came into the world to secure for your sheep life in abundance. Having made an
offering for our sins you ascended into heaven and poured out the promised Spirit on all who
believe, that we might have a foretaste and earnest of our inheritance---for God himself is the
portion of our souls. So now we beg you, our Lord and Mediator, that you would reveal to us the
secrets of our hearts, and awaken our consciences, and enlighten our eyes, that the confidence and
hope on which we build our lives would only be the promises you have given to us in your holy word.
Have mercy upon us, O Jehovah, have mercy upon us, for we have had more than enough of contempt. Our
soul has had more than enough of the scorn of those who are at ease---those who glory in the
flesh, those who rely on the fleeting and illusory contrivances of their minds, those who believe
without understanding or sobriety---we have had enough of these attitudes which we find in our own
hearts and in the hearts of others. And so we ask you to reveal to us the futility of such hope,
teaching us to abhor the thoughtless, irrational and foolhardy confidence which some ignorantly call
faith. But we, in the spirit of true faith, believe in your word, and seek the blessings which
you have promised to give to those who wait for you. Being confident of this we will proceed to
study your teaching by the aid of your Spirit, through whom we make this intercession---Amen._

## Preliminaries: Definitions and Disclaimers

Now Christianity is objectively true. It can (and must!) be analysed intellectually to the extent
that the seeker is capable. I challenge you---if you are a genuine inquirer---to come to Jesus of
Nazareth, as the Queen of Sheba did to Solomon, with "hard questions". He will answer all your
questions, nothing is hidden from him that he will not explain to you, and if you are patient you
will see his wisdom until there is no more breath in you (1 Kings 10:1-9). Soon you will declare:
> Behold, the half was not told me. Your wisdom and prosperity surpass the report that I heard.  
> 1 Kings 10:7b

Jesus is greater than Solomon, in him are hidden all of the treasures of wisdom and knowledge
(Colossians 2:3).  To outshine the sun who is the giver of its light, to show himself honest who is
Truth itself, to distinguish himself from vain idols who is the Creator, blessed forever---these are
easy things in the eyes of the Lord. So let nothing I say in this article be interpreted as an
attack on rational investigation of the facts, which must always be given priority: "the credibility
of Scripture is sufficiently proven insofar as natural reason admits" (Calvin).

Before proceeding any further, let me define two terms, _security_ and _assurance_, as I will be
using them. By _security_ I am referring to the objective reality of the Christian's salvation. By
_assurance_, I mean the Christian's subjective awareness of their own security. In other words, a
secure person is one who is _actually_ saved, an assured person is one who _knows_ they are saved.

From the moment of their justification, the Christian has eternal security. This is the
incontrovertible fact that properly understood may only be denied if the unity of the Godhead is
denied:
> My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and
> they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given
> them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand.
> I and the Father are one.  
> John 10:27-30

Since this doctrine (perseverance of the saints) is not my focus today, I will content myself with 
the observation that in the mind of Christ, only if the Father can be sundered from the Son can an
individual lose their salvation.

Assurance is a much trickier issue. All who are indwelt by the Holy Spirit enjoy a measure of
certainty regarding their salvation (Ephesians 1:12-13). But the moment-by-moment awareness of
salvation, of the presence, favour and love of God---this ebbs and flows in the lives of all
believers.

This is further complicated by the problem of false assurance. There are many unbelievers who are
certain in their own hearts that they are saved:

> On that day many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out
> demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?' And then will I declare to them,
> 'I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.'  
> Matthew 7:22â€“23

Manifestly then, it is possible to have an assurance which is built on sand. We have four categories
of people:
1. Insecure, unassured: this person is lost and knows it
2. Insecure, assured: this person is lost but thinks they are saved
3. Secure, unassured: this person is saved but lacks certainty about their state
4. Secure, assured: this person is saved and knows it

The goal of Biblical self-examination is to move people in (2) to (1), and people in (3) to (4).
That is, to alarm false sheep (in the hope that they will repent) and comfort true followers of
Christ. The tragic irony is that it is much easier to comfort the false and alarm the true, so that
there is a natural tendency for motion to occur from (1) to (2) and (4) to (3).
