It is a blessing indescribable to grow up in a family and social context where the Lord God is known
and feared. To be like Timothy, acquainted from childhood with the sacred writings, when these are
presented by godly parents as what in fact they are: breathed out by God, able to make one wise unto
salvation, useful for teaching, for reproof, for correction etc. so that the truth concerning Christ
Jesus is learned and firmly believed (2 Timothy 3:14-16); to discover as you enter maturity that it
was Jehovah who taught you to walk, who led you with his cords of kindness and bands of love, who
eased the yoke on your jaws, who bent down to feed you (Hosea 11:3-4)---these are the marks of an
immeasurably blessed life.

But it is not without its dangers. "They did not know that I healed them" says this
same Jehovah as he reflects on the treatment he received from Israel (Hosea 11:3b).
"What have I to do with idols? It is I who answer and look after you. I am like an
evergreen cypress; from me comes your fruit" (14:8).
The great danger is that the Lord becomes indistinguishable from his gifts.
And in similar fashion, our understanding of the word of God becomes crystallised in traditional
interpretations, so that we lack the capacity to read the Scripture "like newborn infants, longing
for the pure spiritual milk" (1 Peter 2:1). It is with respect to this latter tragedy I would like
to focus your attention.

It has been my experience that whenever 1 Corinthians 2:9 is read in contemporary evangelical
circles, verse 10 is either glossed over or completely neglected. "__These things__ God has revealed
to us through the Spirit." Which things? "What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man
imagined, what God has prepared for those who love him." The devastating effect of neglecting this
crucial clause is that this wonderful promise is woefully misinterpreted and therefore misapplied to
heaven.

But if you join me in wiping clear the dusty lens of tradition, it should immediately be clear that
Paul has no such idea in mind. He is speaking instead of the glorious truths revealed to believers
with the coming of the promised Spirit. Peter makes a similar statement in his first epistle:

> Concerning this salvation, the prophets who prophesied about the grace that was to be yours
> searched and inquired carefully, inquiring what person or time the Spirit of Christ in them was
> indicating when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the subsequent glories. It was revealed
> to them that they were serving not themselves but you, __in the things that have now been
> announced to you__ through those who preached the good news to you __by the Holy Spirit sent from
> heaven__, things into which angels long to look.  
> 1 Peter 1:10–12 (emphasis added)

Again, note the past tense used and the vital connection to the ministry of the Holy Spirit. 

Ponder for a moment the astounding claim that is being advanced by the apostles in these passages.
The glory of the central truths concerning God and his Christ, the deep things of God, these things
are of such a wondrous nature that they are altogether unlike what is experienced by the lost
world---no, they possess a glory that altogether transcends the experience of the patriarchs, Moses
and the Old Testament prophets.

Jacob wrestled with God through the night, at the end of which ordeal he asks the angel, "what is
your name?" But though he was blessed by God, having his name changed to Israel, he received no
answer, except "Why do you ask my name?" And what was this holy man asking but for God to reveal
himself as Jehovah---yet he was denied this insight which we take for granted.

What of Moses, the man of God? This is he whom the Lord trusted with his name, Jehovah (I AM
WHO I AM); with the giving of the law and the history of the world and Israel. It was Moses who
spoke first spoke of the Messiah as the coming Prophet---indeed, Moses' office is the singular type
that patterned Christ's prophetic role. This same Moses asks Jehovah, "Please show me your glory",
and though he is granted to see something of God's splendour, the response to him is fundamentally
the same: "You cannot see my face, for man shall not see me and live". Yet in our days:

> We all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same
> image from one degree of glory to another.
> 2 Corinthians 3:18a

Finally, among the later prophets, no one saw more of the Messiah's glory than Isaiah and Daniel.
Yet Daniel freely confesses of himself: 

> I heard, but I did not understand. Then I said, "O my lord, what shall be the outcome of these
> things?" He said, "Go your way, Daniel, for the words are shut up and sealed until the time of the
> end.  
Daniel 12:8–9

And Isaiah, the greatest Old Testament herald of Christ, though he was blessed to see much of our
Saviour, concludes his prophecy by anticipating and meditating on the future glory that was to be
revealed:

> Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the LORD has risen upon you.  
> For behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and thick darkness the peoples;  
> but the LORD will arise upon you, and his glory will be seen upon you.  
> And nations shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your rising.  
> Isaiah 60:1–3

In speaking thus Isaiah clearly acknowledges the vast surpassing glory of the time in which the
Messiah is revealed, i.e. in _our_ time.

But with these brief remarks we are yet to exhaust the expansive outline of the promise that Paul
and Peter announce regarding our times. "Things into which angels long to look"---we see in the
Gospels that the coming of the Son of God into the world was an event of cosmic significance, one
which the angels eagerly sought to view. "Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is
full of his glory!" is the cry of the seraphs (Isaiah 6:3), to which the apostle John replies:

> And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son
> from the Father, full of grace and truth.  
John 1:14

Also see John 12:41, in which we get the apostolic interpretation of Isaiah's vision of the throne
as being of Christ.

In short, "No one has ever seen God"---not the patriarchs, not the prophets, not even the angels who
are constrained in reverence and fear to cover their faces---and yet "the only God, who is at the
Father's side, he has made him known" (John 1:18). And he has made him known _to us_, the saints. It
is of this grand transition of incalculable significance, the revelation of the only God through
Christ the Mediator, that Paul and Peter speak.

"For the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God." The Spirit of God was not poured out
from heaven to deal with trivial things like our physical illnesses and financial woes. Fool! Your
life is a breath, a vapor, a mist. There are eternal realities so immense and
marvellous that they cannot be contemplated by our limited and sinful minds without the aid of God's
Spirit. These are realities in the presence of which the finitude of this life and all it
offers---or threatens---becomes painfully manifest. Tell me what is bankruptcy, what is financial
ruin, what is cancer, what are mental illnesses, when God has clothed himself with human flesh? What
does it matter, fleeting pain and pleasure, if the God-Man has taken upon himself your iniquity, if
he has suffered the full measure of God's wrath, died and risen, and purchased for you eternal life?
An eternal life that begins now, one in which you can participate today?

These are the things that the Spirit of God was poured out to teach us, and it is using these truths
_alone_ that he transforms lives. Has he laid hold of your heart with his mighty hand? Do you have
the mind of Christ? Tell me, have you beheld the glory of the Son, have you received grace upon
grace from his fullness? Has the Spirit of God shone in your heart to give the light of the
knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ (2 Corinthians 4:6)? These are the only
questions that matter.

It is my conviction that in the mainstream of what is today called Christianity---and more
particularly, Protestantism---there is a famine of the hearing of the words of God (Amos 8:11-12).
Our gold has grown dim and our pure gold has changed, the holy stones lie scattered at the head of
every street (Lamentations 4:1). The chief consequence of this famine is that it has opened the
Church to the introduction of a deadly, blasphemous, and Satanic heresy regarding the Holy Spirit.
And the teaching of this twisted doctrine must be laid at the feet of the hyper-charismatic,
neo-pentecostal, Word of Faith movement.
What is this teaching, this perversion of sacred truth? It is the idea that the ministry of the Holy
Spirit can be separated from the word of God, and in particular, its central teaching which is only
Christ. This is the idea that the Spirit has or will ever work in a manner that is divorced from the
words that he breathed out through the prophets and apostles he selected.

This notion is emptying the Church of the true spiritual worship God has called for (John 4:24),
worship in spirit _and_ truth.

I am convinced, moreover, that this heresy will not be eradicated or even fought against until
believers come to terms with what the Spirit of God teaches concerning himself and his special
ministry, in his word.

And it is for this alone that I want to militate and plead today. When is the last time your pastor
spoke about the Incarnation and its consequences? What are you being taught regarding the obedience
of Christ and the meaning of his sufferings? Why did Christ ascend and what is the true meaning of
Pentecost? If you are not hearing satisfactorily Biblical answers to this question---and I am bold
enough to say, answers closely related to the material I have outlined today---then know that your
church has forsaken its first love. And if you are not fuelling your life---your devotions, your war
with sin and the ministry that the Lord has given you---if you are not fuelling it with these same
truths, you also have forsaken your first love.

> But I have this against you, that you have abandoned the love you had at first. Remember therefore
> from where you have fallen; repent, and do the works you did at first. If not, I will come to you
> and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.  
> Revelation 2:4–5

It is time, then, for all of us to wake up and strengthen what remains and is about to die, lest the
Lord judge our works as being incomplete in the sight of God.

> Or do you suppose it is to no purpose that the Scripture says, "He yearns jealously over the
> spirit that he has made to dwell in us"? But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, "God opposes
> the proud but gives grace to the humble." Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil,
> and he will flee from you. Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you
> sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded. Be wretched and mourn and weep. Let your
> laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom. Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he
> will exalt you.  
> James 4:5–10
