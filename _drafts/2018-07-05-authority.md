Today I'm going to teach you what these words mean. I have recently become convinced that most
Christians who claim to believe in the authority of the Scripture, or more completely, the
authority of the Holy Spirit as He speaks in all the Scripture, have been sloppy in their thinking,
and have therefore never understood the implications of such a belief.
This should be deeply distressing to the Church, that most professing Christians do not understand
or are too lazy to follow the most basic implications of this, the most basic axiom of the faith.
But this is not a lamentation, so let me proceed to the matter at hand.

This article is not for the faint-hearted, so please leave now if you are not ready to be offended.

To avoid confusion, I must begin by defining the term _implication_ as it is to be understood when
used in the strictly logical sense, which is the only sense in which it should be used. (Dear
friends! We have words like _suggestion_ and _insinuation_ to describe hints and apparent
indications, why should we abuse an important word like _implication_?) I trust that those already
familiar with the word will not take this excursion as an insult, and those who have been guilty of
misusing it will have the humility to [change their ways](/words).

## Prologue: defining implication 
A _logical implication_ is an inference that must be drawn. It is an inference that has to be drawn,
if language has any meaning. The word
[comes from](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/implicatio#Etymology) the idea of one thing being
entwined or entangled with another, so that it is impossible to assert the one without
simultaneously asserting the other.
If you think about it carefully, implication is very closely related (if not identical) to the
concept of definition. To study the implications of a statement is to unfold it, to open what is
contained within it. In an implication, statement _A_ implies statement _B_, and this is said in
three equivalent ways:
1. A implies B which is short-handed as A â‡’ B,
2. B is necessary for A: B _must_ be true if A is true,
3. A is sufficient for B: A being true is _enough_ to deduce B.

Let me give an example. Bachelors are men who have never been married. Thus the statement
1. "John is a bachelor" _implies_ that "John is unmarried",
2. John must be unmarried if he is a bachelor,
3. If John is a bachelor we know enough to conclude that he is unmarried.

Take care that you understand the necessity of this connection, that no man can be a bachelor
without being unmarried.  This is what is known as a _one-way_ implication, and we say that the
unmarried state is necessary but not sufficient to deduce bachelorhood.
Also note that the _converse_ (the implication in the reverse direction) does not hold, an unmarried
man may be a widower, and therefore not be a bachelor.

All of logic, all of mathematics, all of clear thinking is built on understanding and distinguishing
necessity and sufficiency, and the man who masters their subtleties thinks without error. More
importantly, he can interpret the Scripture correctly.
Sadly, it is a deceptively-simple branch of knowledge, because the principles are so basic that we
mostly get it right without conscious effort. But until you understand the rules, you will
_consistently_ make blunders at the fine points of Biblical arguments, which become extremely
important when dealing with matters like eternal security. Foundational issues will seem to be
resolved by hand-waving, and not adherence to the plain teaching of Scripture. You will be powerless
to discern between reverent but subtle exegesis, and inconsistent or manipulative eisegesis.
Is faith necessary for justification? Is it sufficient? What about good works? Are they necessary,
sufficient, or both? The moment you understand necessity and sufficiency, that is, the moment you
understand implication, you will be able to see the perfect harmony between Romans 4 and James 2.

But for now I can only ask you to keep this definition in mind, and to refer to it if at any point
during this article you become confused by my reasoning.

_Everlasting God, long ago You called Your name I AM, for You are the One that is. You alone are
Truth, Being and Reality: in You we live and move and have our being. You have revealed Yourself to
us in the the Eternal Logos, Your very Logic and Wisdom become incarnate and so humiliated for our
sake. Only through the Lord Jesus Christ, the Way, the Truth and the Life do we draw near to You,
and ask for the grace to flawlessly discern the implications of Your holy and consistent statements,
that we may rightly handle the precious and very great promises you have freely given to us. For
You, O God, are a God of peace and not confusion, and You have sent to us the Spirit of truth Who
guides us into all truth. And so, O Father, we affirm the prayer that our great High Priest, now
glorified, still intercedes for us: sanctify us in the truth, Your word is truth.  For it is only in
His name, Beloved to You, that we pray, and so we say, Amen._

## Regula Fidei
The Scripture has been called _regula fidei_, the rule of faith, since the time of the early
Church. In the Reformation, this truth was recovered and it was then called "the norm of norms, which
cannot be normed" and shortly thereafter, "the sole infallible rule of faith and practice".
Anyone with the smallest particle of rationality can see that these are absolute terms. The problem
is that many struggle to deduce the necessary implications of these statements.

- If the Scripture is infallible, can it contain a contradiction?
- What if it's a _really_ small one, perhaps minor oversight in one of the tiresome genealogies that
  fascinated the Jews?
- What about a tiny numerical error? Can it have an inaccuracy irrelevant to the "main message"?

The answer to questions like this has, is and will always be, absolutely not. As the Lord declares,
"Scripture cannot be broken" (John 10:35). So this is the way it works, whenever you think you see a
contradiction in Scripture, you have two alternatives:
1. You can acknowledge in humility that it is your flawed and sinful mind that has failed to see the
consistent truth that is being _clearly_ expressed by the Spirit, ask Him to enlighten Your eyes,
and begin to pursue this _subjective_ reconciliation (for Scripture, being consistent, needs no
reconciliation outside our perverted minds)
2. You can reject Christianity and the audacious claims of an antiquated text written by uneducated
   and uncivilised geocentrists.

Listen to me. To believe in your heart of hearts that the Scripture is contradictory, even on the
most miniscule of points, is to charge the God with ignorance, impotency or deceit. If there is but
one minor contradiction, either He does not know the truth, or He has a speech impediment and cannot
communicate Himself, or He is a liar. I hope that everyone reading this has enough fear of God to
shrink back in terror from such blasphemy. But, because of the great importance of this point, I
will push things one step further. Recall that it is the special office of the Holy Spirit to
inspire the writing of the Bible, because as we are told:
> For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried
> along by the Holy Spirit.  
> 2 Peter 2:21

Dear one, to confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that the Scripture is contradictory
is to commit blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. Please note that I have been precise in my usage of
terms here, so I am not saying that anyone who holds this position fleetingly or in a period of
their life stands condemned. But if you do not believe that God's word, all of it, is truth, then
you are standing on spiritual quicksand, and you will soon be lost forever, unless you repent.
> The grass withers, the flower fades,
> but the word of our God will stand for ever.  
> This is the one to whom I will look: he who is humble and contrite in spirit and trembles at
> my word.  
> Isaiah 40:8, 66:2b

O that our hearts would tremble, suddenly and uncontrollably, with exceedingly-great fear, every
time the thought of doubting, of tampering with, of stretching, of manipulating, of misapplying, or
of practising cunning with the Word of God enters our sinful minds!
Let us learn to flee to our knees and cry with Agur,
> Surely I am too stupid to be a man. I have not the understanding of a man.  
> I have not learned wisdom, nor have I knowledge of the Holy One.  
> Who has ascended to heaven and come down? Who has gathered the wind in his fists?  
> Who has wrapped up the waters in a garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth?  
> What is his name, and what is his son's name? Surely you know!  
> Proverbs 30:2-4

O LORD we do not know the answer to such questions! We are little babes, unlearned and foolish. 
For we know that You oppose the proud, so humble us that You may be gracious.

Do you know, dear Christian, that you know nothing except that which has been given to You in Jesus?
> Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know, and bear witness to what we have seen, but
> you do not receive our testimony. If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how
> can you believe if I tell you heavenly things? No one has ascended into heaven except he who
> descended from heaven, the Son of Man.  
> John 3:11-13  

He and He alone has brought us "grace and truth" (John 1:17):
> For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.  
> 1 Timothy 2:5

Bearing this weighty truth in mind, that all truth is in God, and God is revealed to us only
in His Son, and His Son is revealed to us only by the Holy Spirit, and the Spirit speaks to us only
through His word, shall we begin to twist this word with impunity? 
In the words of Conrad Mbewe, what sane mother would throw her newborn baby into a sewer? If this
prospect moves you to pity, then do not tamper with the word of God, for it is _far_ more
shameless, vile and heartless.
It is safer---a thousand times safer---to drive blindfolded, to shoot an automatic rifle
indiscriminately, to throw a naked flames into gasoline, than to be found misrepresenting God. The
only reason you and I have been spared the just penalty for our sins, every single time we engage in
this folly, is the mercy of God. There is simply _no_ other reason.

Now I do not raise these points to hurt you. I assure you that they scare me just as intensely---if not
more---than most people reading. I make them to expose evil for what it is:
> But when anything is exposed by the light, it becomes visible, for anything that becomes visible
> is light. Therefore it says, "Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on
> you." Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise but as wise, making the best use of the
> time, because the days are evil.  
> Ephesians 5:13-16

## The Authority of the Scripture
These alarming things being said, I will now state the theorem I hope to fix in your mind, which is
sadly all the more disconcerting:  
<p align="center" style="font-weight:bold;">
The persistent and purposeful perversion of divine truth is the committing of apostasy. To
deliberately resist the teaching of Scripture, to publish falsehood when under the conviction of
the Holy Spirit, and to do so lastingly from your heart, is to prove yourself to be an unbeliever.

This is a difficult pill to swallow if you've grown up in the same culture that I have. So bear with
me as I explain the meaning of these words, and demonstrate that they are Biblical.
