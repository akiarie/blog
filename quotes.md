Some short words I wish everyone believed.

### God

> 'In the beginning God created'---It is He, beneficent nature, goodness without measure, a worthy
> object of love for all beings endowed with reason, the beauty the most to be desired, the origin
> of all that exists, the source of life, intellectual light, impenetrable wisdom, it is He who 'in
> the beginning created heaven and earth.'

Basil the Great, _The Hex&#230;meron_

### Providence
> God is the disposer and ruler of all things,---that from the remotest eternity, according to his
> own wisdom, he decreed what he was to do, and now by his power executes what he decreed. We
> maintain, that by his providence, not heaven and earth and inanimate creatures only, but also the
> counsels and wills of men are so governed as to move exactly in the course which he has destined.
> What, then, you will say, does nothing happen fortuitously, nothing contingently? I answer, it was
> a true saying of Basil the Great, that Fortune and Chance are heathen terms; the meaning of which
> ought not to occupy pious minds. For if all success is blessing from God, and calamity and
> adversity are his curse, there is no place left in human affairs for fortune and chance.

Calvin, _Institutes_, I.16.8

### Opinions
> The modern habit of saying 'This is my opinion, but I may be wrong' is entirely irrational. If I
> say that it may be wrong, I say that is not my opinion. The modern habit of saying 'Every man has
> a different philosophy; this is my philosophy and it suits me'---the habit of saying this is mere
> weak-mindedness. A cosmic philosophy is not constructed to fit a man; a cosmic philosophy is
> constructed to fit a cosmos. A man can no more possess a private religion than he can possess a
> private sun and moon.

G.K. Chesterton, _Introduction to Job_

### Jesus
> Love, when it sees, cannot but cast out its spirit and strength upon amiable objects and things
> loveworthy. And what fairer things than Christ! O fair sun, and fair moon, and fair stars, and
> fair flowers, and fair roses, and fair lilies, and fair creatures! but, O ten thousand, thousand
> times fairer Lord Jesus! Alas, I wronged him in making the comparison this way. O black sun and
> moon; but O fair Lord Jesus! O black flowers, and black lilies and roses; but O fair fair, ever
> fair Lord Jesus! O all fair things, black, deformed, and without beauty, when ye are set beside
> the fairest Lord Jesus! O black heaven, but O fair Christ! O black angels, but O surpassingly fair
> Lord Jesus.

John Flavel, _The Fountain of Life Opened Up_
