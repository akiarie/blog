This blog is about _theology_. In other words, this blog is about God.

For a long time, there have had some ideas about this science that I've wanted to express.
I've decided to start sharing some of them publicly now.

The title of the blog is a combination of two ideas. First, it is a read/write stream: I write, and
(I hope) you read. I might add a commenting feature soon.

The second part is an abbreviation of these wonderful verses:

>There is a **r**iver **w**hose **stream**s make glad the city of God,  
>the holy habitation of the Most High.  
>God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved;  
>God will help her when morning dawns.

Psalm 46:4-5  
Jonathan Edwards once [suggested](https://www.ccel.org/ccel/edwards/trinity.html) that this
river, which is referenced throughout Scripture, is a veiled description of the Holy Spirit. I think
that's interesting.

Unless stated otherwise, all Bible verses quoted are from the ESV.
