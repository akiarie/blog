# Part 1: The Need for Robust Biblical Foundations

> For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the
> division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and
> intentions of the heart. And no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are naked and exposed
> to the eyes of him to whom we must give account.  
> Hebrews 4:12-13

Yet when debating controversial social issues such as abortion, Christians often stake the weight of
their arguments---even when the debate is within the Church---on appeals to biology and "science".
And even when they have the sense to appeal to Biblical authority, the arguments advanced tend to be
shallow and inconclusive, built on the foundation of a small collection of isolated proof-texts.
There are not a few problems with these approaches.

First of all, when we begin our arguments on topics like this by appealing to the facts of human
science, all we really do is obscure the issue. Because every sane person walking on the planet
knows that science cannot give us values, so it can never alone serve as the justification for moral
positions. The facts of biology have their place in a discussion like this, but only after we have
established the value system---the worldview---through which judgements should be made. To present
these facts prematurely is to treat our opponents' worldview with a dignity much too lofty for its
desert. We are arguing about the humanity of our infants!---what makes you think they will be
moved by your rigorous demonstration that the zygote has a unique and complete set of DNA?

No, let us reason like Christians. Confusion on an issue as elementary as this does not proceed
_from_ but _to_ the intellect. Where it is present in Christians it will only be cured by the
sanctifying work of God, who does not do this work without means:

> Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth.  
> John 17:17

What of non-believers? Unless our concerns are selfish and pragmatic, the orienting goal that
governs our interactions with the lost is always our desire to drive them to the Cross. If this is
so, then we immediately see that arguments from science are only useful to us insofar as they
provide a path along which we can guide others to a contemplation of human sin and the remedy that
is Christ. In either case, Biblical convictions are primary and essential, scientific considerations
are secondary and ancillary.

Secondly, I mention that the Biblical arguments made by Christians on matters like this tend to rely
on isolated proof-texts. By this I do not mean to discourage the use of individual texts as being
authoritative in their teaching. Perish the thought from under heaven that the Lord God of hosts
need repeat himself before we mortals are bound to do him service:
[one word]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2018-07-05-divine-truth.md %}), I say, one nod from the
Sacred Throne settles all debates forever.

What I am resisting is a kind of ad-hoc, shallow, superficial accumulation of texts which we can
engage in whenever we want to defend a position. When there is no organising principle behind such
an accumulation, or when the principle cannot be demonstrated and defended rigorously from
consistent exegesis, we are abusing the revelation of God. When proof-texts are gathered in this
manner, it is nearly impossible to decide whose collection of texts is appropriate. Our God is not a
god of confusion, he is the God of ordered truth and wisdom. When he speaks there are always
discernible patterns and principles in what he says, and it is in the recognition of these
principles that we begin to perceive and adore his wisdom.

The Lord has no pleasure in fools or in their sacrifices (Ecclesiastes 5:1-4). So if we are to
worship him duly, if we are to defend his truth, if we are to resist evil with effectiveness in this
our Bible-famished generation, we must begin by feeding deeply ourselves. We must cut the spiritual
junk out of our diets and begin to study the Scripture like mature men, not children.

> The spiritual person judges all things, but is himself to be judged by no one. "For who has

> 1 Corinthians 2:12-13, 15-16

It is the joy and duty of our lives to _comprehend_ the revealed truth of God. We are not merely to
study it in separated chunks for we have the mind of Christ: the capacity to understand the whole
span of doctrine that has been given to us in the Scripture. This is what is known as _systematic
theology_.

In what follows I will attempt, by presenting a Biblical argument for the sanctity of human life, to
show the character that our understandings of Biblical teaching will begin to take when we pursue
comprehension of the whole counsel of God, when we devote ourselves to discerning not only the
isolated data but the relational structure revealed to us in Scripture. Whether I have succeeded in
my attempt the reader will have to judge. But more than anything I hope that the value of
approaching Scripture with this kind of intention---the intention of systematic theology---will be
understood, valued and emulated.
