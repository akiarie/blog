Right thinking about hell is as important for the Christian as is right thinking about heaven.
Misunderstanding, or failing to regularly meditate upon, the doctrine of hell is damaging to the
soul. This is because the sufferings of Christ are bound up with this doctrine. Christ redeemed us
from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us (Galatians 3:13). This curse was nothing less
than the full measure of God's holy judgement on account of our sin: "he was pierced for our
transgressions, crushed for our iniquities, upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, the
LORD has laid on him the iniquitiy of us all" (Isaiah 53:5â€“6). 

Now the moment we concede that this judgement and curse is equivalent to anything less than the
fires of eternal perdition, we have at the same time began to think less of Christ.
