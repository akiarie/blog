# Definitions
- By _the Gospel_ I mean the whole counsel of God, as taught authoritatively in Holy Scripture,
   which is in all its contents, from beginning to end, the revelation of Jesus Christ as Mediator
   between God and man.

- By _certainty_ or _faith_ I mean the soul's persuation of, and commitment to, the truth of the
  Gospel: in a word, the saving commitment of the self to Jesus Christ, as he offers himself in his
  Gospel.

- By _security_ I mean the likelihood or probability of an individual person entering heaven.
   That is to say, a secure person is one who will be in heaven.

- By _assurance of salvation_ or _assurance_ I mean, in contrast to certainty, the soul's
   persuation of its own security.

# Propositions
1. Security is the possession of every person who is certain of the Gospel, of every person who has
   saving faith. All the children of God are secure from the moment of their salvation, indeed,
   from everlasting to everlasting, and after they come to faith (certainty) God will at no point
   and in no wise deal with them as lawbreakers, but as beloved children in whom he is well pleased.

2. It is the will of God for all who are in Christ to come to come to have "the _full assurance_ of
   hope" (Heb. 6:11), to boldy "enter with confidence the holy places by the blood of Jesus" and
   "draw near with true heart in _full assurance_ of faith...without wavering" (Heb. 10:19ff.), to
   "confirm their calling and election" (2 Peter 1:10), in order that "perfect love" may cast out all
   their fears (1 John 4:18), and they may sing triumphantly with the Psalmist, "the LORD is my
   light and my salvation, whom shall I fear?" (Ps. 27:1)

3. To this end, he has given them of his Spirit: "_By this we know_ that we abide in him and he in
   us, because he has given us of his Spirit" (1 John 4:13); "And I will ask the Father, and he will
   give you another Helper, to be with you forever, even the Spirit of truth...I will not leave you
   as orphans; I will come to you...In that day you will _know_ that I am in my Father, and _you in
   me, and I in you_" (John 14:15ff.); "The Spirit himself _bears witness with our spirit_ that we
   are the children of God" (Rom. 8:16); "In him you also...were sealed with the promised Holy
   Spirit, who is the _guarantee_ of our inheritance" (Eph. 1:13--14); "'This is my covenant with
   them', says the LORD, 'My Spirit that is upon you'" (Is. 59:21).

4. This witness, the _testimonium Spiritus Sancti salvationis_ (the testimony of the Holy Spirit
   concerning salvation), cannot be reduced to the certainty produced in saving faith, since it
   concerns the individual also.

5. Assurance, which is the effect of this ministry of the Holy Ghost in the lives of believers,
   though like faith the common possesion of the children of God, varies in degree both between
   believers and within the lives of believers.

6. This is because the work of the Holy Ghost is not merely a mystical experience, but something
   produced in organic connection with the ordained means of grace as they are operative in the life
   of the believer: "But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one
   another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin" (1 John 1:7)---assurance grows
   organically through walking in the light in communion with God's people.

7. By abandoning these means of grace, therefore, the believer may undermine to an extent his
   assurance. I do not say what this extent is, except that believers are "never utterly destitute
   of that seed of God, and life of faith, that love of Christ and the brethren, that sincerity of
   heart, and conscience of duty, out of which, by the operation of the Spirit, this assurance may,
   in due time, be revived; and by the which, in the meantime, they are supported from utter
   despair" (WCF 18.4). However, I do say that it is certain that assurance may be shaken.

8. It is important that believers know this assurance varies, so that when it is shaken, they do not
   fall into utter despair. For if the assurance of the godly cannot be shaken it follows plainly
   that he whose assurance is shaken is outside of Christ. Thus the Scripture presents us with
   examples of the godly: "Has God forgotten to be gracious?" (Ps. 77:9); "I had said in my alarm,
   'I am cut off from your sight'" (Ps. 31:21); "For when I kept silent, my bones wasted away
   through my groaning all day long" (Ps. 32:3); "Remove your stroke from me; I am spent by the
   hostility of your hand" (Ps. 39:10); "For I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do
   what I want, but I do the very thing I hate." (Rom. 7:14ff.)

9. It is also important that believers know this assurance depends, in a measure, upon the means of
   grace, in order that they may cultivate it jealously. Hence the Scriptural commands to "confirm
   your calling and election" (2 Peter 1:10), to "show earnestness to have full assurance" (Heb.
   6:11). And it is taught plainly and repeatedly that this is done by walking in the light: "_By
   this we know_ that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments...whoever keeps
   his word, in him truly the love of God is perfected. _By this we may know_ that we are in him:
   whoever says he abides in him ought to walk in the same way in which he walked" (1 John 2:3--6);
   "So we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and _whoever
   abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him. By this is love perfected with us_, so that
   we may have confidence for the day of judgment, because as he is so also are we in this world." 
   (1 John 4:16--17)

10. The Bible comforts the sinner who desires holiness, but condmens the one who hardens his heart
   in sin. God's kindness leads to repentance (Rom. 2:4) and God cannot be mocked, whatever a man
   sows, that shall he also reap (Gal. 6:7). "God opposess the proud but gives grace to the humble"
   is in this sense a summary of the Biblical doctrine of assurance: the proud can have no security,
   and should regard themselves as hanging on the precipice over hell; yet the humble, no matter how
   grave their transgressions, be they so many as the stars in heaven and the grains of sand on the
   seashore, may always return to "an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous" (1 John
   2:1).

11. Good works done out of gratitude for God's love and good works done in order to multiply and
   confirm assurance are so far from being in contradiction to one another that they are one and the
   same reality viewed from different angles. Good works are the expression of sonhood, the
   imitation of our Father, and such expression therefore, without being mercenary, feeds the
   conviction that this sonhood is a reality. So that to grow this conviction we seek to abound in
   good works, and where these works are absent or latent this conviction must needs be weakened.

12. It is not mercenary to seek to be conformed to the image of Jesus Christ. The mercenary attitude
   enters only at that point where our actions are done in order to achieve a reward which those
   actions are not organically related to. Assurance is a fruit yielded in season on the tree that
   is the righteous man, planted by streams of water. "By this my Father is glorified, that you
   bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples" (John 15:8)---for as long as we keep our eyes
   fixed on this organic relationship there will be no difficulty in working for God's glory and
   working to confirm our calling and election. Does the sunflower angle itself toward the sun in
   order to bask in the sun's glory, or in order to flourish? Isn't this a false dichotomy? C.S.
   Lewis makes this point very clear in his famous address _The Weight of Glory_. I make no apology
   for quoting him at length: 
    > The New Testament has lots to say about self-denial, but not about self-denial as an end in
    > itself. We are told to deny ourselves and to take up our crosses in order that we may follow
    > Christ; and nearly every description of what we shall ultimately find if we do so contains an
    > appeal to desire. If there lurks in most modern minds the notion that to desire our own good
    > and earnestly to hope for the enjoyment of it is a bad thing, I submit that this notion has
    > crept in from Kant and the Stoics and is no part of the Christian faith. Indeed, if we
    > consider the unblushing promises of reward and the staggering nature of the rewards promised
    > in the Gospels, it would seem that Our Lord finds our desires, not too strong, but too weak.
    > We are half-hearted creatures, fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite joy
    > is offered us, like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum because he
    > cannot imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea. We are far too easily
    > pleased. 

    > We must not be troubled by unbelievers when they say that this promise of reward makes the
    > Christian life a mercenary affair. There are different kinds of reward. There is the reward
    > which has no _natural connexion_ with the things you do to earn it, and is quite foreign to
    > the desires that ought to accompany those things. Money is not the natural reward of love;
    > that is why we call a man mercenary if he marries a woman for the sake of her money. But
    > marriage is the proper reward for a real lover, and he is not mercenary for desiring it. A
    > general who fights well in order to get a peerage is mercenary; a general who fights for
    > victory is not, victory being the proper reward of battle as marriage is the proper reward of
    > love. The proper rewards are not simply tacked on to the activity for which they are given,
    > but are the activity itself in consummation. 

13. Believers should therefore have no qualms about encouraging one another to work for the reward
   of multiplied assurance. Provided that this is done without suggesting that salvation is by
   works, we are well within the bounds of Scripture. Listen to the Saviour, "Whoever has my
   commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my
   Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him." (John 14:21) Tell me, does he foster
   works-based salvation and the self-righteous attitude? Does anyone dare accuse him of undermining
   the principle of grace which he himself enacted into operation that very night? Does he teach
   that God loves us because we keep his law? The truth is that God teaches us he loves us---and
   that we love him---by _empowering_ us to keep his law. The New Covenant involves God writing his
   law on the hearts of his people: "I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their
   hearts" (Jer.  31:33).  Why should we think it strange for God to assure us by manifesting to us,
   in our very lives, the sanctifying impact of his grace?

14. Assurance, like every part of the Gospel, is a heavenly mystery, beyond the reach of the natural
   man. It is Spiritually discerned, and folly to those who are perishing. Moreover, _abusus non
   tollit usum_ (abuse does not destroy proper use): we cannot argue from the shipwrecks of faith
   which those who misunderstand this doctrine have made to its invalidity. Let us instead, without
   wavering or fearing, lift up our drooping hands and strengthen our weak knees, so that what is
   lamed may not be put out of joint but rather healed, in order to strive for peace and the
   holiness without which no one will see the Lord. Let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that
   cannot be shaken, and thus let us offer to God acceptable worship, with reverence and awe, for
   our God is a consuming fire (Heb. 12:12ff.)
