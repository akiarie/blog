# Disclaimers
The intention of this article is not to make a personal attack on Jonathan Leeman. For many reasons,
such as his willingness to engage in conversation with those whom he sharply disagrees with
(consider his appearance on CrossPolitic), I do not want to characterise him as a political actor,
or even create doubt about his personal commitment to Jesus Christ as his Saviour. I would not have
us regard Leeman as an enemy, but warn him as a brother. Yet notwithstanding this, words have
meaning. What he has written as the editoral director of 9Marks, influences the churches, and he is
responsible for it. 

Secondly, I think it entirely fair to represent Leeman's position as that of 9Marks as a whole,
given his position as editorial director:
![Leeman Tweet](/assets/images/leeman-tweet.png)
However, if anyone can point to a senior member of the 
[9Marks team](https://www.9marks.org/about/our-team/)
who disagrees with Leeman's perspective, I will happily retract the charge in the title.

## Scripture's Sufficiency as defined by 9Marks
(Note that I am using the term _sola scriptura_ in the title as including within itself the
sufficiency of Scripture.)

In 
[Episode 52](https://www.9marks.org/conversations/episode-52-on-the-sufficiency-of-scripture/)
of Pastors' Talk, Leeman and Dever discuss the topic of the sufficiency of Scripture. Leeman begins
by asking Dever to provide a definition:
> That God has revealed himself in his word, giving us everything we need to know for life, and
> knowing him, and following him.  
> (Mark Dever)

However, unsatisfied with the potential vagueness of the term "life", Leeman proceeds to quote
the following from Grudem:
> ...sufficiency of Scripture means that Scripture contains all the words of God he intended his
> people to have at each stage of redemptive history, and that it now contains all the words of God
> we need for salvation, for trusting him perfectly, and **for obeying him perfectly**.  
> (Wayne Grudem, as quoted by Leeman, emphasis mine)

Today, I mean to fasten unyieldingly to the phrase _for obeying him perfectly_: according to
Jonathan Leeman, to Mark Dever, and to 9Marks, at least on 15 May 2018, Scripture contains _all the
words of God we need for obeying God perfectly_. We shall see whether this conviction has lasted the
storm of these three short years, or if perhaps it has been modified by some pragmatic and
humanistic considerations.

## Leeman's departure
It is a dangerous thing for fallen creatures to reason and philosophise. It is necessary, but
always dangerous. For this reason we are warned by the apostles, "learn by us not to go beyond what
is written" (1 Cor. 4:6). Ideas are most damaging to the church when they appear to have been
deduced by good and necessary consequence from the word of God. I say this because I think what
has happened in Leeman's case is he has confused his political science with his systematic theology,
and confused his systematic theology with the word of God.

This is a danger to which we are all open. None of us is above the constant need to test by the
written word every thought that arises in our minds. All of us must depend on the guidance of the
"Holy Spirit speaking in the Scripture" and upon the "infallible rule of interpretation of
Scripture" which is "the Scripture itself". The moment we begin to love and trust our systems more
than we love and trust the solemn voice of the prophets, "Thus saith the Lord", we will land
ourselves in the contradictions of what is falsely called "knowledge" about which Paul warns (1 Tim.
6:20).

Turn to Leeman's recent writing on the COVID-19 controversy and you will find a sudden illustration
of the fickleness of human reason. In an article titled 
[_When Should Churches Reject Governmental Guidelines on Gathering and Engage in Civil Disobedience?_](https://www.9marks.org/article/when-should-churches-reject-governmental-guidelines-on-gathering-and-engage-in-civil-disobedience/) 
published in May last year, he explains
why (in his opinion) the question is difficult. 

### "jurisdictional overlap"

Simple Christians may be forgiven for their naivete if they are surprised when Leeman, while
professing to be speaking "from a biblical perspective", instead of launching into an exegetical
analysis of (i) whether the church is commanded to gather and (ii) the circumstances under which
this command does not apply and finally, (iii) whether we are in such a circumstance, hurls at them
an unfamiliar term, _jurisdictional overlap_. 

"But brother", some of us would ask Leeman, "what is this strange word, _jurisdictional overlap_?
And is it found on the pages of Scripture?" Now at this point it may be objected that there are
many extra-biblical, theological terms which Christians have used through the centuries to capture
Scriptural concepts, such as _trinity_, _sacrament_ and the like. So let us read on and see if
Leeman is advancing the church's knowledge in a manner analogous to Tertullian's use of _trinity_,
let us see if _jurisdictional overlap_ is nothing but a new name for a biblical matter.

I will quote Leeman at length now:

> Here's why it's a difficult topic from a biblical perspective: both the government and our
> churches have a legitimate biblical claim on the territory of gatherings. You might call it
> jurisdictional overlap.  
> Governments possess authority, if for no other reason, then to preserve human life (see Gen.
> 9:5–6). They are obligated by God to do so. If temporarily banning all gatherings of a certain
> size accomplishes that end, they should.  
> At the same time, churches possess a right to gather, arguably as a property of a natural right to
> freely assemble, certainly as the religious right to assemble. Our vertical obligation to worship
> God as churches creates that horizontal right with respect to other people and our governments.

![Jurisdictional Overlap in COVID19](/assets/images/leeman-overlap.png)

> So picture two overlapping circles, one representing the church's jurisdictional obligation and
> right to gather, the other representing the government's jurisdictional obligation to protect
> life. Our pandemical moment places us smack dab in the middle of where these jurisdictions
> overlap. That, as I said, is what makes this moment difficult.

(The illustration above is taken from the article.)

The first observation to be made may appear to be a minor one. Leeman characterises the government's
authority as "to preserve human life" while citing Gen. 9:5–6. Yet this text says nothing explicitly
about preserving human life, indeed on the contrary, it is the divine institution of capital
punishment for murderers:
> And for your lifeblood I will require a reckoning: from every beast I will require it and from
> man. From his fellow man I will require a reckoning for the life of man. 
> Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed, for God made man in his own image.

We are immediately led then to suspicion regarding this supposed overlap of authority, since the
first text which Leeman offers in its defense rests upon the unargued assumption that the government
bears the sword, not as a terror to bad conduct and as "an avenger who carries out God's wrath on
the wrongdoer" (Rom. 13:4) but as a preserver of human life. In effect, this is to turn the state
into the institution of healthcare, rather than the institution of civil justice, and who can doubt
that this is what most Christians who defend the COVID-19 restrictions believe—but let us not get
ahead of ourselves.

The second observation is that in Leeman's mind, the _jurisdictional obligation_ of both the
government and the church is to God. He says of the former that "they are obligated by God" to
"preserve human life", of the latter he speaks of "vertical obligation to worhsip God" and
"jurisdictional obligation and right to gather". I think there can be no doubt that the obligation
is to God, given this context.

### "First, peace and safety. Then church work. At least typically."
Leeman continues:

> If the government has a reasonable argument to ban every kind of gathering in order to protect
> life, then churches should act the part of dutiful citizens and obey the government. **They
> shouldn't just "go along with the government by our own free will," as a friend of mine put it.
> They should positively submit**. Submitting to it is to submitting to God (Rom. 13:1–2).  
> Why should the government's authority come first? **Because preserving life now allows for the
> freedom to gather later. You cannot gather as a church if you're dead**. Paul therefore tells us
> to pray for kings, and to lead and peaceful and quiet lives so that people can be saved (1 Tim.
> 2:1–4). **First, peace and safety. Then church work. At least typically**. 

We begin now to see Leeman's priorities, i.e. "at least typically". He considers it within the
government's authority, when it "has a reasonable argument", to "ban every kind of gathering",
including the church. At this point I would raise a red flag. Is this something he has even began to
demonstrate biblically? The church is to "positively submit", to submit as unto God, he says,
referring to Romans 13. Does this text say anything about the government's right to ban church
gatherings? Doesn't it instead speak about its obligation to punish evildoers? Where does healthcare
even enter into consideration there?

Yet what follows is even more troubling. "You cannot gather as a church if you're dead", says
Leeman. I am afraid our brother is suffering from a woefully under-realised eschatology. It is true
that the saints of old cried to God,
"Sheol does not thank you...The living, the living, he thanks you, as I do this day" (Isa. 38:18)
and
"Is your steadfast love declared in the grave, or your faithfulness in Abaddon?" (Ps. 88:11). But is
this the language of believers living under the reign of the Messiah? Listen to our Lord:
> Fear not, I am the first and the last, and the living one. I died, and behold I am alive
> forevermore, and I have the keys of Death and Hades.  
> (Rev. 1:17–18)

Yes, David asked, "What man can live and never see death? Who can deliver his soul from the power of
Sheol?" (Ps. 89:48) and the Son of David answers upon his resurrection "I am alive forevemore, I
have the keys of death of Hades". We have a God, yea a man, "who knows his way out of the grave".


> For none of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself. For if we live, we live to the
> Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord. So then, whether we live or whether we die, we are the
> Lord's. For to this end Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and of
> the living.  
> (Rom. 14:7–9)

This, and not "first, peace and safety", is the cry of the New Testament. "First, peace and safety",
even if qualified by "at least typically", is the cry of human pragmatism. It is cowardice and
ungodly fear of those who can destroy the body but cannot touch the soul.

"First, peace and safety"—but Paul says "to live is Christ, to die is gain"—"at least typically"—but
Paul says "now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death" (Phil.
1:20–21).
"First, peace and safety"—but Peter says "rejoice insofar as you share in Christ's
sufferings, that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed"—"at least
typically"—but Peter says "do not be surprised at the fiery trial...as though something strange were
happening" (1 Peter 4:12–13).
"First, peace and safety...at least typically"—but John speaks of himself as "your brother
and partner in the tribulation and the kingdom and the patient endurance that are in Jesus" (Rev.
1:9).
"First, peace and safety...at least typically"—but Jesus says "In this world you will have
tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world" (Joh. 16:33)
"First, peace and safety...at least typically"–but an apostle says, "It is for dsicpline that you
have to endure. God is treating you as sons. For what son is there whom his father does not
discipline?" (Heb. 12:8)

I seriously doubt that Leeman has realised how far his sentiment is from that in Scripture.
"First, peace and safety. Then church work."—tell that to Paul:

> Are they **servants of Christ**? I am a better one—I am talking like a madman—with far greater
> labors, far more imprisonments, with countless beatings, and often near death. Five times I
> received at the hands of the Jews the forty lashes less one. Three times I was beaten with rods.
> Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked; a night and a day I was adrift at sea; on
> frequent journeys, in danger from rivers, danger from robbers, danger from my own people, danger
> from Gentiles, danger in the city, danger in the wilderness, danger at sea, danger from false
> brothers; in toil and hardship, through many a sleepless night, in hunger and thirst, often
> without food, in cold and exposure. And, apart from other things, there is the daily pressure on
> me of my anxiety for all the churches.  
> (2 Cor. 11:23–28, my emphasis)

Note that for Paul this is what characterises "servants of Christ". It seems in this context that
the false teachers of Paul's day knew better than Leeman what "church work" was about, since they
competed with Paul not for "peace and safety" but for having endured more suffering. The sentiment
of the believer is to glory in sharing in Christ's suffering:
> For he was crucified in weakness, but lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but
> in dealing with you we will live with him by the power of God.  
> (2 Cor. 13:4)

"First, peace and safety. Then church work." "You cannot gather as a church if you're dead." But the
Bible tells us:

> ...you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to
> innumerable angels in festal gathering, and to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in
> heaven, and to God, the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect, and to
> Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than
> the blood of Abel.  
> (Heb. 12:22–24)

Are we to understand that there is no church in heaven?

But sadly, we have not yet come to the bottom of Leeman's delusion.

### Leeman (unwittingly?) denies the Scripture's sufficiency
We come to the heart of Leeman's position when he asks whether the church may engage in civil
disobedience. (The emphasis below is Leeman's.)

> If you were paying close attention, however, you caught my two qualifications.  
> First, the government has to have a **reasonable** argument. A totalitarian state which completely
> banishes the freedom of assembly probably doesn't have such a reasonable argument. One ground for
> civil disobedience, then, would be when it's overwhelmingly obvious to good sense and reason that
> the government has no legitimate basis for banning gatherings.

Again, naive readers may be forgiven for thinking the governments which banned singing in church,
permitted thousands to gather (and riot and loot and destroy property) for BLM protests and yet
forbade hundreds to gather for church, were totalitarian and unreasonable:

> To be sure, determining what's a reasonable argument or a legitimate basis requires case-by-case
> judgments, and Christians might disagree. Stopping a pandemic which kills more than 50,000 U.S.
> citizens within a month strikes me as pretty reasonable.

Note that Leeman provides no context for this figure. He sees it unnecessary to use the CDC's own
admissions that the vast, vast majority of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. included on average 4.0
serious comorbidities. 
([That number](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#Comorbidities) is above
94%, as of today.)
Many more objections could be registered against Leeman's superficial quotation of these figures.
Perhaps we should give him grace since this was May of last year, yet in
[this](https://www.9marks.org/article/must-churches-follow-mask-mandates/)
article from September 2021 he reasons in exactly the same way. But returning to the May 2020
article, he goes on to say,

> Second, the government cannot single out religious groups. If it allows sporting events and
> concerts and political conventions to meet, then it should not forbid churches from meeting. If a
> government does single out churches, again, then the church may have biblical warrant to disobey.

How can this be squared with what we now know regarding BLM protests?

Yet all this absurd inconsistency is not the heart of Leeman's view. Here it is (my emphasis):

> One pastor asked me what he should do if he disagreed with the government's assessment of what is
> reasonable. Should they meet anyway? **In the final analysis, there is no black and white answer
> when jurisdictions overlap that we can look up in a book of case-law**. The definition of
> submission is deferring to another's judgment, rather than your own. Still, every authority on
> earth is relative. No authority is absolute except God's, which means we never surrender judgment
> to another human entirely, and therefore we have to ask God for wisdom and rely on him in these
> tough cases of jurisdictional overlap.

So a pastor asks 9Marks whether the church should meet in defiance of goverment regulations and the
response is "In the final analysis, there is no black and white answer when jurisdictions overlap
that we can look up in a book of case-law". Hmmm—I thought we had a book, the Bible? Surely we're
misunderstanding Leeman? Surely "we have to ask God for wisdom" is a reference to consulting his
revelation, which contains _all the words of God we need for obeying God perfectly_? 

Leeman again (my emphasis):

> As such, **the ultimate test comes on Judgment Day**. So if you're tempted to disobey, ask
> yourself, do you believe God will vindicate your disobedience by saying to you on the Last Day,
> "Yes, you were correct, pastor, to lead a congregation to overlook what I said in Romans 13
> because the government was asking you to sin"? Those are high stakes. That should make you
> nervous.

But how, pray tell, is the pastor to know if God will vindicate his obedience? How, since "the
secret things belong to God" and today (so far) is not judgement day? Leeman leaves him "nervous"
and with "no black and white answer", rather than with a word from the Scripture.

And so the article concludes, with some soft words about loving our neighbors and preserving our
witness by submitting to an authority when we do not know if we are obeying God. But Leeman
addresses this same point again in the aformentioned article from September. Perhaps he will at last
tell us that the Bible is sufficient to answer us? Sadly, he does the precise opposite (my
emphasis):
> ...the ultimate theological answer is, everyone who will stand before God and account for their
> obedience both to church and state must decide. He has established both authorities. To submit to
> both is to submit to him. **That means, most conflicts in these areas of overlapping jurisdiction,
> where you can find a Bible verse to support each side, won't finally be resolved until Judgment
> Day. God alone will adjudicate them perfectly then. In the meantime, we ask God for wisdom and
> make our best judgments**.

What a great change. Yesterday he says we have "all we need for obeying God perfectly" but today he
says we wait "until Judgement Day" when "God alone will adjudicate them perfectly".

### "our best judgements"
To put Leeman's political-scientific jargon into simple language, by _jurisdiction overlap_ he means
_a contradiction in the revealed will of God_. This is why we have to wait for judgement day, and he
openly admits "you can find a Bible verse to support each side". Note that he doesn't say "you can
find a Bible verse that _seems_ to support each side"—note that his whole argument and position
rests on the "conflicts in these areas of overlapping jurisdiction".

He may not intend to, but he has with his philosophy annihliated the Scripture's sufficiency and
authority, and left us "to ask God for wisdom" and to "make our best judgements". And unless Leeman
believes that God is still revealing his word authoritatively to the church, he has left us to "our
best judgements".

This is an affront to the majesty of God's word, and a departure from the Protestant view of
Scripture. Indeed, it is a departure from the view allegedly held by 9Marks.


## The Good and Perfect Will of God
For those who believe that the will of God "is good and acceptable and perfect" (Rom. 12:2) Leeman's
position needs no refutation. Indeed, its very statement is its own refutation. I will therefore not
venture into the work of refuting it, which seems most vain and unnecessary.

Let us not follow Leeman into his political-scientific world with no "black and white" answers.  The
Bible is the Church's book of case-law, and every other kind of law, its only and sufficient rule of
faith and practice. Let us instead call our brothers in 9Marks to repentance from this drift towards
theological liberalism: for the meaning of Scripture _is not manifold, but one_.
