One way in which theistic evolution is impossible to square with the biblical worldview is in the
doctrine of man, in anthropology. 

The Bible teaches that God created man in his own image, after his likeness (Gen. 1:26–27, 5:1,
etc.) The specific denotation of the creation in the _imago Dei_ is something that requires an
extended, exegetical study that I am not prepared to undertake today. For our purposes in this
brief article, I will be content to make the following observation:

## The _Imago Dei_ is the Chief Definitional Characteristic of Man's nature.

When God creates man (in Gen. 1), the only defining characteristics given are
that he is to be "in our image, after our likeness" (v.&nbsp;26) and "male and female":

> So God created man in his own image,  
> in the image of God he created him;  
> male and female he created them.  
> Genesis 1:27

Given the parallelism between the clauses, which is present in 5:1–2 also, it is safe to conclude
that the sexuality ("male and female") of man is an aspect or outworking of the _imago Dei_, or at
the very least, closely bound up with it.

Moreover, pressing the terms, it is of the utmost importance to recognize that man is not made
_with_ the image of God, or given the divine image as something to bear. Rather, he is made _in_ the
image, and _after_ (1:26) or _in_ (5:1) the likeness of God.

We may therefore conclude that the image of God is either exactly identical with the nature of man,
or it is something so inherent, so central, so definitional, that nothing more need be said to
communicate what is essential about man than that he is God's image.

## Evolution is at Odds with this Doctrine.

Darwinian evolution envisions a gradual process in which the various species, and mankind also,
emerge out of previous forms. This emergence is the result of "natural selection" working on random
mutations from generation to generation to generation to the necessarily-billionth order. It is a
pervesely speculative theory with no possible scientific demonstration, because it is a history
rather than an explanation of phenomena in operation today.

For reasons that escape the writer of this article, some Christians are confused enough to regard
this theory as compatible with the Scripture. They have progressively, in Darwinian fashion,
dreamed up something they call _theistic evolution_. They pay no attention to the plain fact that
the Darwinian theory was invented to eliminate God and the Scriptural witness to his creation, and
instead blindly insist that we as Christians cannot be "left behind" and must heed what scientists
say to us, or people will not take us and Scripture seriously. This attitude is sadly one of
compromise, forgetting that "the wisdom of this world is folly with God". But God will not be
mocked: "He catches the wise in their craftiness" (1 Cor. 3:19).

The theologians who attempt to reconcile Genesis with Darwin have spilled much ink to prove that
the first chapter of the Bible is a hymn, an exalted song, a supra-literal, a sub-scientific
writing—in sum, an uncertain but artistic conglomeration of words that tell us nothing specific
except that "God somehow created everything".

The simple point I want to make here is that evolutionary theory is irreconcilable with the biblical
doctrine of man as the image of God. The reason for this is found in the gradual, step-by-step
nature of the Darwinian view. This gradualism implies that there are no radical jumps between Adam
and his immediate sub-human ancestors, but rather, everything we see in Adam was produced in a
sequence of infintesimal changes.

Now if this is admitted to be the case, we must ask what the creation of Adam in God's image
entails. Compare Adam's father, whom we shall call _Homo ante Homine_, "the Man before Man", or
_HaH_ for short (cf. Psalm 2:4).
Because of the gradualism that produces Adam out of HaH that there is nearly-exact correspondence
between Adam and his ape-father HaH. HaH is 99.99% (or more) correspondent to Adam.

We ask the question: Is HaH made in the image of God? Since he is _not_ Man, the answer
to this must be in the negative. On this view, then, the image of God can be conceived of in only
two possible ways:

1. The 0.001% (or less) which distinguishes Adam from HaH is the _imago Dei_.

2. The _imago Dei_ is something which is superadded to Adam, such as a distinction or blessing
   bestowed upon him, but not something integral or essential to his nature.

Both of these clearly undermine the biblical doctrine of the image of God. In the first way, the
image is reduced to an infintesimal distinction bewteen Adam and HaH's genomes, a single nucleotide
of no inherent importance. In the second way the image of God is no longer what Adam _is_, but
something laid on him, like a garment.
The first approach is impossible because a single gene cannot be the reason why God would say that
he made man "after his likeness".
The second approach is likewise futile because it externalizes and decentralizes the very thing
which the Scripture internalizes and centralizes. Man is not said to be made and then given divine
likeness. He is said to be made in the image.

## Conclusion.

One therefore sees how contrary the evolutionary framework is to the teaching of Scripture. It
requires gradualism at the very place where the Scriptural witness requires abrupt divergence. It
would have God, as it were, remain in silence after Gen. 1:24–25 and watch "hominids" emerging from
among the beasts of the earth "according to their kinds". Instead of God's voice, the silence of a
hundred-million years of undirected, random development.

Christians who believe in the truth of Holy Scripture should have no time for such nonsense. God
speaks before creating Man, and defines the sharp boundary between Man and all the other creatures
he has made by making him in his image. The immediacy of God's creative act is underscored by the
account in Gen. 2 where it is stated explicitly that the man of dust became a living creature
because God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, a reference Holy Spirit's role in the
creative act. 

It is impudent and impious folly to attempt to shoehorn endless ages and billions of species into
these verses. It is dishonouring to God and obviously the result of compromise to the wisdom of the
world. Let us have done with it and _avoid the irreverent babble and contradictions of what is
falsely called "knowledge," for by professing it some have swerved from the faith_ (1 Timothy
6:20–21).
