Some short words I wish everyone believed.

### God

>'In the beginning God created'---It is He, beneficent nature, goodness without
>measure, a worthy object of love for all beings endowed with reason, the beauty
>the most to be desired, the origin of all that exists, the source of life,
>intellectual light, impenetrable wisdom, it is He who 'in the beginning created
>heaven and earth.'

Basil the Great, _The Hex&#230;meron_

### Opinions

>The modern habit of saying "This is my opinion, but I may be wrong" is entirely irrational. If I
>say that it may be wrong, I say that is not my opinion. The modern habit of saying "Every man has a
>different philosophy; this is my philosophy and it suits me"--the habit of saying this is mere
>weak-mindedness. A cosmic philosophy is not constructed to fit a man; a cosmic philosophy is
>constructed to fit a cosmos. A man can no more possess a private religion than he can possess a
>private sun and moon.

G.K. Chesterton, _Introduction to Job_

### Jesus
>Love, when it sees, cannot but cast out its spirit and strength upon amiable objects and things
>loveworthy. And what fairer things than Christ! O fair sun, and fair moon, and fair stars, and fair
>flowers, and fair roses, and fair lilies, and fair creatures! but, O ten thousand, thousand times
>fairer Lord Jesus! Alas, I wronged him in making the comparison this way. O black sun and moon; but
>O fair Lord Jesus! O black flowers, and black lilies and roses; but O fair fair, ever fair Lord
>Jesus! O all fair things, black, deformed, and without beauty, when ye are set beside the fairest
>Lord Jesus! O black heaven, but O fair Christ! O black angels, but O surpassingly fair Lord Jesus.

John Flavel, _The Fountain of Life Opened Up_
