Cornelius Van Til taught that antitheistic reasoning is "of necessity and
inherently _abstract_" (my italics). In explaining what he meant by this word,
he continued to say, "It means reasoning with inadequate categories."[^1]

This abstractness shows itself nowhere more violently than in discussions
regarding freewill and determinism. The question is usually posed as
"Does Man Have Freewill?" or "Is the Cosmos Deterministic"? But these are highly
abstract and vague questions, because they treat a transitive concept (freedom)
as though it were intransitive and terminal. The real question is, "Who or What
Determines Man?" and "Of Whom or of What is Man's Will Free?"

Take, as an example, the following description of the problem:

> In the philosophical literature, one finds three main approaches to the

> Compatibilists, however, claim that determinists and libertarians are both
> confused and that free will is compatible with the truth of determinism.  
> Sam Harris, _Free Will_, "Changing the Subject".

Note that Harris identifies the heart of the question (between determinists and
libertarians) as whether "our behaviour is fully determined by background
causes". As far as he is concerned, this is the key point of distinction.
Again, between compatibilists and incompatibilists the question is whether
"free will is compatible with the truth of determinism".

The question of the determining agency appears as insignificant, and he speaks
only of "background causes". And from here he launches into an argument for what
he calls _determinism_, but in truth he is speaking of _determinism from below_,
i.e. Man as determined by natural (subhuman and subrational) causes. This is
what he really means by determinism.

The Bible teaches that all things are determined by God, and this is a
completely different thing from saying that all things are determined by
Newton's laws of motion. The one views the Omnipotent Creator ruling the world
he made, the other is a reductionistic denial of the existence of higher-order
creatures. The goal of this essay is to show just how divergent these views are:
we shall call the former _Supradeterminism_ (determinism from above) and the
latter _Infradeterminism_.
