<!-- Introduction and Disclaimers -->
In this essay I intend to provide my perspective on the supposed beliefs of those who today call
themselves Atheists. In a word, I think that there is nothing _atheistic_ about their views, indeed
they are possessed by precisely the kind of superstition they decry in their rhetoric. But I want to
make some preliminary remarks to guard against certain misunderstandings.


# Logic
By _logic_, I mean language and reason: the capacity we have to understand propositions, to their
deduce necessary consequences, and to communicate them to one another in a way that conserves their
relationships.

Since we live in a perverse age, I will take a moment to prove that every sane human being believes
in the _absolute_ validity of logic. But first, some definitions are in order.

#### Interlude: Some Definitions
A _proposition_ is a statement that is either true or false. For example, the statement 'God exists'
is a proposition, while 'it is daytime' is not (think dusk). Thus if _P_ is a proposition, then its
opposite _non P_ is also a proposition. By this definition, it should be clear that it is never
possible for _P_ and _non P_ to both be true: this is known as
[the law of non-contradiction (LNC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_noncontradiction).

_Necessary consequence_ or _logical implication_ describes the situation where the truth of one
proposition is immediately deducible from the truth of another. In other words, an implication is a
strict 'if P then Q', in which case we say that 'P implies Q' or 'Q is necessary for P'.
Necessity is the beating heart of logic, and is fundamentally about unpacking definitions.
For example, if a man is a bachelor, then he is (maritally) single. Thus bachelorhood implies
singleness, or singleness is (logically) necessary for bachelorhood.

Simply put, correct logic is the careful use of language.
