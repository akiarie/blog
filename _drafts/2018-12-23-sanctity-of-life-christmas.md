## The Need for Robust Biblical Foundations

> For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the

It is not uncommon to hear Christians, when debating controversial social issues such as abortion,
staking the weight of their arguments on appeals to biology and "science". Worse, this tendency is
observable even when such debates occur within the Church. Moreover, when they have the sense to
appeal to Biblical authority, the arguments advanced are often shallow and inconclusive, built on
the foundation of a small collection of isolated proof-texts. There are more than a few problems
with these approaches.

First of all, when we begin our arguments on topics like this by appealing to the facts of human
science, all we really do is obscure the issue. Because every sane person walking on the planet
knows that science cannot give us values, so it can never alone serve as the justification for moral
positions. The facts of biology have their place in a discussion like this, but only after we have
established the value system---the worldview---through which judgements should be made. To present
the scientific facts prematurely is to treat our opponents' worldview with a dignity much too lofty
for its desert. We are arguing about the humanity of human infants!---what makes you think they
will be moved by your rigorous demonstration that the zygote has a unique and complete set of DNA?

> And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what
> ought not to be done.  
> Romans 1:28

No, let us reason like Christians. Confusion on an issue as elementary as the humanity of the unborn
does not proceed _from_ but _to_ the intellect. When we find such confusion in (professing)
Christians it is an indication either of spiritual immaturity or false profession. The former can
only be cured by the sanctifying work of God, who does this work by means of his truth: 
> Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth.  
> John 17:17

What of non-believers? Unless our concerns are selfish and pragmatic, the orienting goal that
governs our interactions with the lost is always our desire to drive them to the Cross. If this is
so, then we immediately see that arguments from science are only useful to us insofar as they
provide a path along which we can guide others to a contemplation of human sin and the remedy that
is Christ. In either case, Biblical convictions are primary and essential, scientific considerations
are secondary and ancillary. It is imperative therefore that we always begin by laying foundations
in the teaching of Scripture.

Secondly, I mention that the Biblical arguments made by Christians on matters like this tend to rely
on isolated proof-texts. By this I do not mean to discourage the use of individual texts as being
authoritative in their teaching. Perish the thought from under heaven that the Lord God of hosts
needs to repeat himself before we mortals are bound to do him service:
[one word]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2018-07-05-divine-truth.md %}), I say, one nod from the
Sacred Throne settles all debates forever.

What I am resisting is a kind of ad-hoc, shallow, superficial accumulation of texts which we can
engage in whenever we want to defend a position. When there is no organising principle behind such
an accumulation, or when the principle cannot be demonstrated and defended rigorously from
consistent exegesis, we are abusing the revelation of God. When proof-texts are gathered in this
manner it is nearly impossible to decide whose collection of texts is appropriate. The effect is
that people with mutually contradictory perspectives all feel justified in calling their views
_Biblical_, and it is even possible for the debates to become competitions over who can gather the
most texts in support of their position.

Our God is not a god of confusion, he is the God of ordered truth and wisdom. When he speaks there
are always discernible patterns and principles in what he says, and it is in the recognition of
these principles that we begin to perceive and adore his wisdom.
He has no pleasure in fools or in their sacrifices (Ecclesiastes 5:1-4). So if we are to
worship him duly, if we are to defend his truth, if we are to resist evil with effectiveness in this
our Bible-famished generation, we must begin by feeding deeply ourselves. We must cut the spiritual
junk out of our diets and begin to study the Scripture like mature men, not children.

> Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might
> understand the things freely given us by God. And we impart this in words not taught by human
> wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual.   
> The spiritual person judges all things, but is himself to be judged by no one. "For who has
> understood the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?" But we have the mind of Christ.  
> 1 Corinthians 2:12-13, 15-16

It is the joy and duty of our lives to comprehend the revealed truth of God. We are not merely to
study it in separated chunks, for we have the mind of Christ: the capacity to understand the whole
span of doctrine that has been given to us in the Scripture. This pursuit is the spiritual
discipline of _systematic theology_.

In what follows I will attempt, by presenting a Biblical argument for the sanctity of human life, to
show the character that our understandings of Biblical teaching will begin to take when we pursue
comprehension of the whole counsel of God, when we devote ourselves to discerning not only the
isolated data but the overarching structure revealed to us in Scripture. Whether I have succeeded in
my attempt the reader will have to judge. But more than anything I hope that the value of
approaching Scripture with this kind of intention---the intention of systematic theology---will be
understood, valued and emulated.

## The Principle of Divine Sanctification
For the sake of brevity, I will begin by stating the principle, then I will demonstrate it from a
selection of texts.

<p align="center" style="font-weight:bold;">
    Because he is holy, whenever God draws near to or interacts with a part of his creation in a
    peculiar way, he sanctifies this part of his creation.
</p>

By _sanctify_ I mean he sets it apart or distinguishes it in such a way that all who fear him are
required to revere him by means of the sanctified object. The Lord does not interact with creation
in a haphazard or random manner, so while we must guard ourselves against superstition, we must pay
careful attention to the choices he makes when revealing himself, as they bear significance.
However, in this article the specific details are not my concern, as these vary even as the manner
of God's interactions with his creation vary. The essential point is that to disregard or profane
the sanctified object is to disregard or profane its Sanctifier.

Let us now consider some key texts in which this principle is manifest.

### Sanctification of the Sabbath
> And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day
> from all his work that he had done. So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it
> God rested from all his work that he had done in creation.  
> Genesis 2:2â€“3  

In recording the institution of the Sabbath ordinance, Moses consistently emphasises that its origin
is in the actions of God in the creation of the world. The text does not merely say that God blessed
the seventh day---it specifies to us the means by which he conferred this blessing: "because on it
God rested". A substantially similar comment is made in the giving of the Law:
> For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on
> the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.  
> Exodus 20:11
