> Oh, taste and see that the LORD is good! Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him!  
> Psalm 34:8

It is an utterly sublime fact that the truth of the Christian religion is subjectively verifiable.
"Oh, taste and see"---David in his holy joy does not tell us to "reason and conclude that the LORD
is good."

Now Christianity is objectively true. It can (and must!) be analysed intellectually to the extent
that the seeker is capable. I challenge you---if you are a genuine inquirer---to come to Jesus of
Nazareth, as the Queen of Sheba did to Solomon, with "hard questions". He will answer all your
questions, nothing is hidden from him that he will not explain to you, and if you are patient you
will see his wisdom until there is no more breath in you (1 Kings 10:1-9). Soon you will declare:
> Behold, the half was not told me. Your wisdom and prosperity surpass the report that I heard.  
> 1 Kings 10:7b

For Jesus is greater than Solomon, in him are hidden all of the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
To outshine the sun who is the giver of its light, to show himself honest who is Truth itself, to
distinguish himself from vain idols who is the Creator, blessed forever---these are easy things in
the eyes of the Lord. So let nothing I say in this article be interpreted as an attack on rational
investigation of the facts, which must always be given priority: "the credibility of Scripture is
sufficiently proven insofar as natural reason admits" (Calvin).

My focus today is on assurance of salvation. For the sake of clarity, let me define two terms,
_security_ and _assurance_, as I will be using them. By _security_ I am referring to the objective
reality of the Christian's salvation. By _assurance_, I mean the Christian's subjective awareness of
their own security.

The Christian, from the moment of their salvation, has eternal security. This is the
incontrovertible fact that properly understood may only be denied if the unity of the Godhead is
denied:
> My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and
> they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given
> them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand.
> I and the Father are one.  
> John 10:27-30

Since this doctrine (perseverance of the saints) is not my focus today, I will content myself with 
the observation that in the mind of Christ, only if the Father can be sundered from the Son can an
individual lose their salvation.

But assurance is far more tricky. While believers generally tend to be convinced of their salvation,
there are many reasons why this conviction may be shaky. Tragically, this is most often the direct
result of unmortified sin in their lives, which grieves the Spirit within them:
> And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
> Ephesians 4:30

The same Spirit, being the earnest of their inheritance (Ephesians 1:13-14), often withholds
assurance, which is his gift to give (Psalm 51:11-12), in order to arouse believers from their
sinful slumbers.

The other reason why believers struggle with assurance is ignorance (Hosea 4:6), which is rarely
independent from Spirit-grieving sin.

Now it should go without saying that security of salvation is of crucial importance, but what of
assurance? It is almost as crucial, as a moment's reflection reveals. Imagine, for example, that
