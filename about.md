My name is Amisi Kiarie.

This blog is about _theology_. In other words, this blog is about God.

For a long time, there have been ideas about this science that I've wanted to express.
I'm sharing some of them publicly now.

The title of the blog is a combination of two ideas. First, it is a read/write stream: I write, and
(I hope) you read. I intend to add a commenting feature soon.

The second idea is an abbreviation of these wonderful verses:

>There is a **r**iver **w**hose **stream**s make glad the city of God,  
>the holy habitation of the Most High.  
>God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved;  
>God will help her when morning dawns.  
Psalm 46:4-5  

Jonathan Edwards once [suggested](https://www.ccel.org/ccel/edwards/trinity/files/trinity.html) that this
river, which is referenced throughout Scripture, is a veiled description of the Holy Spirit. I think
that's highly interesting, but I'm still trying to determine its truth.

Finally, a disclaimer. I make no attempt or pretence at originality. As has been said by a wise man,
in theology, _new_ is just another term for _heretical_. I will try as much as possible to be
honest about quotations, but in general, my policy will be to acknowledge references only when I
want to direct readers to thinkers that would be edifying.

I also promise to, unapologetically and without warning, switch between first, second and third
person, in their singular and plural variants, because this is my site and I am not ashamed to
disregard arbitrary writing conventions that have only ever confused me.
