This blog is about _theology_. In other words, this blog is about God.

Here I will define some important words, not as the world uses them, but as they _should_ be used.

* _theology_: this is the study of God. Forget _academia_, this is something that
  [everyman](https://www.the-highway.com/theology_Gerstner.html) must do.
* _science_: knowldege. There is nothing more to it, and don't believe anyone who tries to
  convince of anything by throwing this word in your face.
* _logic_: human reason. Careful thinking that is designed to avoid absurdities and contradictions.
