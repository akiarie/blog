Christians today speak often, though not often enough, of the wrath of God. It is a rare thing,
however, to hear about the wrath and malice of Man. The effect of this is people are permitted to
conceive of the Almighty (whose throne is in heaven) as a petulant and irritable being, and of his
judgements as tyrannical and despotic. Now why does this happen? It happens because our view of God
is wrong---but also because our view of Man is wrong.

Most people today conceive of Man as a kind of cosmic victim. We speak of the tragedy of life and
the problem of evil. One has only to make eye-contact with an atheist and he starts: _How could an
all-powerful and all-good God allow so much suffering?_ 

But it is not the world only. Christians continue to struggle with the doctrine of eternal hell.
When asked about hell, we do not call it everlasting conscious torment in the fires of God's fury.
We do not call it the righteous vengeance of God on the wicked. Instead, we tend to describe it as
separation from God. God loves all men, we say, but he will not force them to worship him. Thus we
are fond of Lewis's idea that the door to hell is locked from the inside. The thought that the
Redeemed in heaven will look into hell and praise God---a thought the Bible appears to teach---we
find deeply unsettling. Some of us, in our more doubtful moments, begin to question the unendingness
of hell. Something about it seems inadequate and unloving, inconsisent with a God who is love.

Now I do not want to persuade Christians to stop talking about separation from God, as this is
Biblical langauge, 2 Thessalonians 1:9. Neither do I pretend to be one who can look into eternity
without being unsettled. But I do want to offer help to some who have not learned, either because of
neglect or ignorance, to think rightly about _the justice of God in the damnation of sinners_.

What is the wrath of Man? It is the attitude he has in his fallen state towards the living God.
Fallen Man loves his idols, and his chief idol, his own belly. But he abhors the true God and rages
against him. Why does he have this attitude? There are many reasons, but they are all connected to
the fact that he knows God to be his judge. He has this knowledge "fixed in his bowels", though he
strives with all his might to efface it from his conscious mind.
> The fool says in his heart, "There is no God."  
> They are corrupt, they do abominable deeds;  
> there is none who does good.  
> Psalm 14:1

One has only to think about it in this way. What would sinners do with God if for one moment they
had him under their power? Think of a man who does not believe that God exists---and this fact does
not fill him with horror and despair---but with peace. What conclusion should we draw about his
desires? Surely, it is his desire to exist somewhere where there is no God. Now he is told that
there is a God in heaven who requires of him perfect obedience.  Does he not certainly wish that, if
it were possible, this God would disappear?  Or think instead of a man who believes in a god---but
not the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. If once he were made aware of the reality of the
true God, would he not certainly wish, if it were possible, that this God would disappear?  The
conclusion then is that sinners would destroy God, all they lack is the power. They are attempted
Deicides: God-murderers.

> The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was allowed to scorch people with fire.
> They were scorched by the fierce heat, and they cursed the name of God who had power over these
> plagues. They did not repent and give him glory.  
> Revelation 16:8â€“9

The instinct of Fallen Man, when faced with mounting evidence that he is under God's judgement, is
not to repent. It is not to seek mercy, or even _merely_ to embrace despair. His instinct is to rage
and curse God, to continue to raise his flag of opposition. What is this hatred in its essence?
Where does it originate?
