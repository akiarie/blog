This blog is about _theology_. In other words, this blog is about God.

If God used his Word to create the world, if the Incarnate Word is my Lord, if the saving message
of the Gospel must be expressed in words, then a few good words might be worth fighting for.

Here I will define some important words, not as the world uses them, but as they _should_ be used.
Once you agree, vow to stop abusing them and let's start fixing the world together.

* _theology_: this is the study of God. Forget _academia_, this is something that
  [every man](https://www.the-highway.com/theology_Gerstner.html) must do.
  You only get to choose between being a
    * Bad theologian, possessed by traditions you don't understand and the zeitgeist of your day and
    * Learning the truth for yourself, by reading the Bible carefully and logically.

* _science_: knowldege. There is nothing more to it, and don't believe anyone who tries to
  convince of anything by throwing this word in your face. People like that are illusionists and
  they have nothing to offer you but smoke, mirrors, and an empty life.
* _logic_: human reason. Careful thinking that is designed to avoid absurdities and contradictions.
